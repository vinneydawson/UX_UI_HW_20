      <h4>Initial Research Insights</h4>
      <p>Although the travel industry has seen major hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been significant leadership from companies that are pivoting their strategies to maintain long-term growth.</p>
      <h5>4 Key Factors:</h5>
      <h5>Demand</h5>
        <p>People want to travel again and they are booking.</p>
      <h5>Leisure</h5>
        <p>Travelers are forced to prioritize relaxing spaces.</p>
      <h5>Location</h5>

      <h4>Initial Interview Process</h4>
      <p>5 interviews lasting no more than 20 minutes were conducted in order to learn more about travel habits, patterns, and behaviors from a variety of personality types. The names of the interviewees have been changed for anonymity.

        “Sheri” is a mom of 2 who likes to travel, but feels burdened by the difficulty of creating an itinerary for her whole family. 
        
        “Mark” loves the outdoors and hiking with friends, but has a hard time finding time to book his vacations due to his busy work schedule.
        
        “Aubrey” enjoys spending money for fun activities and travel, but gets overwhelmed with all of the options and various applications.
        
        “David” is a first-class traveler who enjoys luxury amenities, but isn’t tech savvy and relies on a in-person travel agent to ensure his trip goes smoothly. 
        
        “Rebecca” appreciates cleanliness and safety while traveling to lesser known areas. She uses all the tech her phone will allow, but is looking for an all-in-one travel solution.</p>

        <b>“Draft 1: Sophie needs help booking her travel arrangements because it’s hard to manage multiple apps and websites for a single trip.”</b><br>
        <br>
        During a feedback session, I was able to iterate my insight statement to further my understanding of the user persona that has been developed throughout the interview process.<br>
        <br>
        <b>“Draft 2: Sophie, who is family-oriented with a busy work schedule, needs a quick way to research and book travel arrangements for her family vacations because it is hard to manage multiple resources efficiently with her current process that she’s developed out of frustration.”</b></p>

        <b>RESEARCHING FOR TRAVEL TAKES TOO MUCH TIME.</b><br>
        <p>Impact: To decrease the amount of time it takes to research travel experiences.<br>

          <b>“How might we</b> streamline the travel research process that users go through?”</p>
        
        During a feedback session, I was able to iterate my insight statement to further my understanding of the user persona that has been developed throughout the interview process.<br>
        <br>
        <b>BOOKING TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS CAN BE COMPLICATED.</b></p>
        <p>Impact: To make the travel booking process more efficient.<br>

          <b>“How might we</b> simplify the way users interact with a travel app?”</p>

        <b>TOO MANY WEBSITES & APPS TO MANAGE.</b></p>
        <p>Impact: To consolidate other travel service functions into a single app format.<br>
          <b>“How might we</b> integrate into other travel services?”</p>

        <img id="how-might-we-questions" src="images/how-might-we-questions.jpg">

        <h4>Insight Discovery</h4>
        <p>During user interviews, I’ve discovered that Sophie, who is family-oriented and has a busy work schedule, needs a quick way to book travel arrangements for her family vacations.

          Therefore, I believe that making the travel booking process more efficient would help simplify Sophie’s current process and that I might be able to help if I provide automation services. 
          
          I might do this by leveraging existing APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to bring existing travel services closer to the user. 
          
          Doing this will allow TravelBot to provide an automated travel booking process that enables the user to have a one-stop-shop experience.</p>

          <img id="insight-discovery" src="images/insight-discovery.jpg">

          <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
          <p>TravelBot was designed to achieve a one-stop-shop solution for researching and booking travel arrangements. We have observed through user insight discovery that our service needs to collaborate with other companies in order to streamline the booking process, which is causing a development roadblock to our business. How might we integrate existing structures into TravelBot so that our customers are able to successfully research/book travel arrangements based on usability factors?</p>

          that TravelBot is simple and easy to use<br>

          that TravelBot allows me to research and book at the same time<br>

          that TravelBot shows me reviews<br>

          that TravelBot saves me time<br>
          <br>
          <h5>I Wish...</h5>
          I could share my itinerary with friends and family<br>

          I could manage other services in one place<br>

          I could chat with my group<br>

          I could be recommended curated experiences<br>
          <br>
          <h5>What if...</h5>
          TravelBot could book trips for you<br>

          TravelBot could recommend deals based on my schedule<br>

          TravelBot had a rewards system<br>

          TravelBot had a referral program<br>

          <p>Using a Madlib format, I conceptualized a value proposition statement that addresses how TravelBot could help users and why it could potentially compete with other apps.</p><br>
          <p>"My organization TravelBot LLC is developing a mobile app to help travelers automate and manage their travel booking experience quickly and efficiently so that they have more time to experience life.</p><br>
          <p>We're better than our competition because we offer a unique solution that consolidates multiple aspects of booking travel arrangements into one, simple app.</p><br>
          <p>We're believable because our ability to integrate into 3rd parties allows us to provide a one-stop-shop experience while maintaining professional relationships with other travel booking services."</p><br>

      <h4>Utilzing The User Testing Plan</h4>
      <p>I conducted a final round of usability testing on the mid-fidelity prototype to gather data moving forward to the final high fidelity prototype.</p>
      <b>Insight Discovery: Users wanted a personalized, interactive walkthrough experience.</b>

      <h4>What have I learned?</h4>
      <p>This case study has taught me how to conduct user research to further understand how I might be able to offer a travel booking solution within a large competitive market. </p><br>
      <p>Through the defining and ideation stages, I was able to hone in on who I might want to target within this market which ultimately contributed to my development of a value proposition. </p><br>
      <p>During the prototyping phase, I was interested in conducting user tests and using the feedback received to iterate on top of my existing mockups allowing me to get closer to a final prototype.</p><br>
